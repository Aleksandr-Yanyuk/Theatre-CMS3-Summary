 <h1>Theatre Vertigo<h/1> 
<h2>Internship-Live Project</h2>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a part of a two week long live project where we had sprint/stand up/retrospective meetings Monday-Friday. In this team project I created a contact page for the Theatres Website and I also created the MVC for the calendar events. I am very passionate about how the final project looks like, so I made sure to make these as user friendly and aesthetically pleasing as I could within the time frame.
     
     
<h2>Created Entity Model For Calendar Event And CRUD Pages</h2>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this area of the web application I was tasked with several stories that included utilizing entity framework for the model scaffolding and CRUD functionality and styling based on the color scheme defined within the project. I also developed a way for Calendar Events to be added to the database in the index page. I used CSS to style the Create and Edit pages of the web application.

  <h2>Styling The Contact Page</h2>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this story I was assigned the task of designing the Contact page for the Theater Vertigo web application. I utilized Bootstrap and CSS to create the content and styling of the Contact page utilizing a specific color scheme defined within the project. I created a contact form for the user to input their contact information. Along with the Contact form I created buttons for the user to be click on and they are directed to the Donate and Volunteerpages of the web application.
